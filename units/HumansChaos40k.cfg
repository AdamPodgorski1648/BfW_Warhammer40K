    description="Human Chaos followers are individuals who have forsaken their allegiance to the Imperium of Man and pledged themselves to the dark powers of Chaos. Drawn by promises of power, immortality, and liberation from the rigid doctrines of the Imperium, these traitors and heretics serve the Chaos Gods with fanatical devotion. Their bodies and minds are often twisted by the corrupting influence of the Warp, manifesting in physical mutations. Whether through personal ambition or the desire to overthrow the oppressive regime of the Imperium, human Chaos followers represent a significant and insidious threat to the galaxy."
