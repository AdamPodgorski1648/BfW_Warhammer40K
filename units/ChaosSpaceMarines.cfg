    description="Chaos Space Marines, also known as Traitor Marines, are the corrupted and twisted counterparts to the loyalist Space Marines. Once noble defenders of the Imperium, these superhuman warriors fell to the lure of the Chaos Gods during the Horus Heresy, a galaxy-spanning civil war. Now, they serve the dark powers of Chaos, driven by hatred, ambition, and a thirst for power. Their bodies and minds are tainted by the Warp, granting them unholy power that makea them fearsome adversaries on the battlefield."
